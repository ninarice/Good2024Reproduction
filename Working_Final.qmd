## Power Over Presence: Women’s Representation in Comprehensive Peace Negotiations and Gender Provision Outcomes

### A Replication Project by Nina Rice and Erika Garza Elorduy

# **1. Introduction**

-   Summarize key information about the authors’ analysis for someone who has not read their paper.
-   Describe what additional model or models you want to consider and why.
-   Evaluate which of the models you consider performs better on an out-of-sample predictive basis. I.e., you will use cross-validation to compare your models.
-   Interpret the relationship between an independent variable and the dependent variable in the best-fitting model you found. Be sure to specify your quantity of interest.
-   Explain what you learned about the data and models you explored.

# **2. Summary of the Original Paper**

## **2.1. Unit of Analysis and Sampling**

-   What is the unit of analysis? I.e., what are the cases in the dataset?
-   Do you have any concerns about observational independence?
-   How were the data sampled (an internet survey? All available cases? something else?)

## **2.2. Dependent Variable (`GeWom`)**

-   What is the dependent variable for the model you are replicating?
-   How many observations are there?
-   Describe the DV. Include a plot of the distribution of the DV and highlight any important qualities (binary? categorical? truncated in some way? Rare? Bimodal? etc.)

## **2.3. Missing Data & Handling Strategy**

-   How did the authors handle missing data?
-   Provide a **missingness map**.

## **2.4. Original Model**

-   What kind of model are you replicating (logit? probit? negative binomial? etc.)?
-   What do the original authors hope to achieve with the statistical model(s) you focus on? (description? prediction? causal inference?)
-   Replicate the **original model** and show results: Demonstrate that you successfully replicated the authors’ original model. This means you will include a regression table in your paper in which the coefficient estimates, standard errors, and the number of observations are exactly the same as in the original paper.

# **3. Replication Results**

-   **Regression table** comparing our estimates to the original.

# **4. Alternative Model**

-   State the additional model(s) you are considering. The additional model(s) must be fit to the same dependent variable.
-   Explain why you chose the model(s) you did.
-   Fit at least one alternative model to the same DV.
-   Provide a regression table that reports the results from this new model(s).
-   Compare coefficients and goodness-of-fit metrics.

# **5. Model Comparison Using Cross-Validation**

-   Use k-fold cross-validation to assess model performance.
-   Compare the original model and your new model(s) based on their in- and out-of-sample predictive performance.
-   Decide which model you think is best and justify your decision.

# **6. Interpretation of Key Independent Variable**

-   For the best model, describe how a particular independent variable of your choosing relates to the dependent variable.
-   A good paper will include a carefully described quantity of interest and present the interpretive estimate in table or graphical form that accurately incorporates our uncertainty around the estimated quantity of interest.

# **7. Conclusion**

-   Summarize findings and compare them to the original paper.
-   How confident are you in the authors’ conclusions after this exercise?
-   What more would you like to see done with this paper?
-   Discuss limitations and potential next steps.
